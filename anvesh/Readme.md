ðŸ’» Projects I've Worked On
I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of exciting projects, which have helped me grow as a developer:

-Learning Management System (LMS)
A capstone project focused on backend development using Node.js and PostgreSQL. I implemented robust authentication using bcrypt.js and developed a system that simplifies learning management.

-Lost & Found Application
This web app, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), helps people reclaim lost items. It was a key project during my internship at CodeSprint, where I learned about responsive design and full-stack development.

-Project Management System (PMS)
A project built using React and TypeScript as part of my WD301 capstone, this system enhances project management with intuitive interfaces and powerful functionality. It was recognized as a finalist in a hackathon conducted by Link Innovations, Bangalore.
